                In the essay “Society of the Spectacle”, <br>Guy Debord mentions that “Everything that <br>was directly lived has moved away into a representation.” <br>Debord points out that representation has <br>replaced the real experience and <br>he is very critical about that. <br>I believe the representations did <br>deprive people from being into the reality.
