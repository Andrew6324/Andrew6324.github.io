Officials from the U.S. intelligence community have concluded that China’s public reporting on the number of cases and deaths that China had reported to the world were intentionally incomplete. Vice President Mike Pence says “The reality is that we could have been better off if China had been more forthcoming, what appears evident now is that long before the world learned in December that China was dealing with this, and maybe as much as a month earlier than that, that the outbreak was real in China”.</div>

Asymptomatic cases were not even included in the numbers at all until a month ago. Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement after Bloomberg News published its report- “Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the regime.”. In response to these comments, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China’s state-run Global Times says “There was no way for serious data faking to occur in today’s China, especially for an incident that has drawn such widespread attention”.<div><br></div></div>

It was noted that many of the statements that WHO gave regarding the virus echoed those that Chinese officials gave or vice versa. For example, the day that WHO reported that there was no proof for human to human transmission regarding coronavirus, Wuhan officials reported the same information hours later. China has a great political influence over WHO, which makes it vulnerable to misinformation. The WHO receives funding from China and is dependent on the regime of the Communist Party on many levels. Due to this, the WHO has regurgitated misleading information given by Chinese authorities.&nbsp;<div><br></div></div>

By the time that Chinese officials have confirmed that coronavirus could be transmitted through human to human contact, it was too late. When asked how many people have been put in quarantine, isolation, or residential restriction, a representative of WHO referred to numbers from China’s National Health Commission-which are much smaller than the numbers calculated by the New York Times. It is clear that data given by WHO is unreliable due to the influence that China poses over them. As a result, Trump has sought to cut off US funding to the organization.&nbsp;<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says “China poses a threat to the world by hiding information about the origin of the coronavirus that it allowed to spread to other countries.”. China has the responsibility of being truthful in releasing information regarding coronavirus. As the virus did, in fact, originate in China, it is imperative that China releases information regarding the origins and spread of the virus.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though it is important to recognize that Chinese officials were at fault for concealing information about the outbreak when it first happened, it is equally important to recognize that the Chinese people, and Asian Americans are unrelated to this and not at fault. As the number of cases regarding racism against Asian Americans go up, Asian Americans are put in danger by the misinformation and anti-Asian sentiments that are magnified by the use of words like Chinese virus.</div><div><br></div></div>

However, behind the danger on the surface, misinformation, another threatening enemy is lingering in the dark. In specific, misinformation toward Asians is prevalent nowadays which inevitably lead to racist language and actions toward this group of ethnicity. According to the report from Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), Chinese for Affirmative Action (CAA), the STOP AAPI HATE report center has received more than 1100 reports of coronavirus discrimination across the country during its first two weeks. Though the virus is originally discovered in China where Asians are the primary ethnicity, it does not justify the fact that Asians are currently becoming a target of assault, both verbally and physically, in the U.S.<div><br></div></div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">First, it is clear that the Chinese government is slow on reaction to the original outbreak in Wuhan which contributed to a large part of the following global outbreak. In fact, in later December 2019, a doctor in China, Wenliang Li, had already filed reports on patients cases caused by an unknown strand of coronavirus. However, the Chinese government is reluctant to take radical actions toward the issue. It was reported later in 2020 that after the Li made the warning of the virus, he was quickly muted by governmental agencies and was called to report at the local police station for spreading un-proven information that would potentially cause the public to panic. Aside from censoring the source of the information, under the political environment of the spring festival, and an important and on-going governmental meeting, China had made more moves to further hide the existence of the approaching threat. The primary goal of the Chinese government at that time was to hide instead of taking caution. Between January 6th and 27th, only a few hundreds of cases were reported which in large misinform the rest of the world about the level of threat of the virus. The government only started to accelerate in a movement when the position is getting out of hand. On January 23rd, Wuhan, where the virus is originally discovered, was locked down by the Chinese government. However, a rather late action taken had failed to stop the virus from spreading to the world. At the time, people in Wuhan had already traveled to different areas of the world include the continent of America and Europe. The lockdown was mostly an utterly inadequate method in dealing with the severe situation.<div><br></div></div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Though China bears the most responsibility in failing to prevent the virus from spreading, the common enemy is still the virus itself instead of Asians, the group of ethnicity. After the situation accelerated in the U.S, misinformation about the virus quickly changed the way many people react to Asians. A lot of people started to believe that Asians should take full responsibility for the existence of the virus and the consequences caused by it. The racism toward Asians was quickly formed and it was contributed by both the public and governmental officials. First, Trump’s insistence use of the “Chinese virus” had really stirred up the flame. Though the WHO in February had already named the diseases COVID-19, Trump still chooses to call the diseases with a term that relates to certain groups of ethnicity. Though Trump had twitted about a call for protection of Asian Americans later, he still was in defense of using the term: Chinese virus, The Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s uses of term–Wuhan Virus–also shifted blame onto anyone who bears the look of Asians. Public figures clearly had forgotten their role and ability in causing bigotry. As on April 28th, more than 30% of the Americans had witnessed bias toward people of Asian descent. Though 19% of Americans are currently sheltered in place. The incidence of attacks of all kinds toward Asians is still taking place.</div>

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 is a perfect example. According to the journal article, “The Chinese as Medical Scapegoats in San Francisco, 1870-1905,” Asians Americans also endure a history of being the scapegoats and discriminated against during pandemics in many cases. During the Smallpox outbreak in 1875, the government officials blamed the source on the unwholesome living condition of Asian Americans, especially on their food process habits, in Chinatown. Though there was no clear correlation proven. The discrimination can be seen from the fact that several hospitals at that time also refused to provide medical care to Chinese patients.</div>

In specific, officials like Trump and Pompeo chooses to call the virus with a name that directly relates to a certain ethnicity. Regarding misinformation, since the origin of the virus can be traced to a market in Wuhan, people in the U.S again start to put discriminating tags on Chinese food. Ultimately, The current racism crisis toward Asian Americans is caused by both the non-doing of the government and misinformation conveyed during the time.&nbsp;<div><br></div></div>

Fortunately, after the initial spike in the numbers of assault after Trump used the term Chinese Virus publicly in March and the enforcement of laws that ask residents to wear masks in public in several states like New York, the numbers of cases had gradually declined in the month of April. Compared to the initial reports of over 1100 cases received in March, in April only a few hundred more cases were reported. The decline in cases is also contributed by Asian celebrities who chose to stand out in public to make efforts to clarify.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><br></div></div>

On March 16th, three days after declaring national crisis, Trump first called Coronavirus “Chinese Virus”. Reported from the Washington Post photographed the word “Coronavirus” being crossed out on Trump’s notebook and was replaced by “Chinese Virus”. This idea comes from Trump’s administration team, specifically from the Secretary Mike Pompeo. After Trump’s stop use of “Chinese Virus” on March 24th, Secretary Pompeo continues to use “Wuhan Virus” to refer to the Coronavirus in the G7 Summit 2020. Also, one of the counselors in Trump’s administration team, Kellyanne Conway made a statement on TV demonstrating why the Coronavirus has to be called COVID-19 instead of COVID-1. She implies that the virus has 19 versions made by Chinese lab. However, COVID-19 in fact stands for COronaVIrus Disease of 2019. Unclear whether it’s made in a Chinese lab or originated from the bat that someone consumes, I am sure Conway lacks basic knowledge about Coronavirus as part of the President's administration team. Therefore, President Trump’s administration team is as incompetent as he is.</div><div><br></div></div>

            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">So why does Trump try to scapegoat China for the pandemic so hastily. I believe it’s all about the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election. However, Donald Trump’s blaming game against China could be traced back to as early as 2016 when he was running for the president. This has become his long-term strategy to blame China and this strategy has already been implemented during the Trade War between the US and China. Moreover, a national crisis like the Coronavirus Crisis is like a test for President Trump. He was pretty confident at the beginning. However, he seems to have failed this exam of fighting the Coronavirus crisis. And it just shows how completely incompetent Donald Trump is as president during this hard time. In a recent BBC News report, Trump claims that China is trying to make him lose the re-election. In an interview to Reuter, Trump says “China will do anything they can to have me lose this race.”&nbsp;</div>
