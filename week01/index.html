    <p style="font-family:arial"> When John Berger comes to the discussion of the traveling of image, it really struck at that moment. Nowadays, modern technology and mass production makes it possible for any art pieces to be much more approachable to the ordinary people than ever before. People don’t have to travel all the way to Europe to have a look at Mona Lisa at Louvre Museum. Appreciating this art piece can be done by just one click on the internet. The image of Mona Lisa would just pop up on your computer screen in less than one second. It is that easy. However, something more has also been changed. Then meaning of the art piece has been changed. Viewing Mona Lisa on the computer screen when you sitting at home is definitely different from appreciating that art piece when you are standing on the floor of Louvre Museum; moreover, when the same art piece appears on the page of newspaper, it has different meaning when it is presented in a documentary, because the people who show or use the art piece to present his ideas give the art piece more meanings other than what Leonardo da Vinci originally was trying to convey.

    <p style="font-family:arial"> Since paintings are silent and still, their original meanings could be distorted by the movement of camera. When viewing the painting as a whole piece, it could approximate its original meaning; however, when the camera focus on one single character or an isolated scene in the painting, the original meanings could be distorted. And this is due to the manipulation of the movement of camera. Moreover, sound effects could also manipulate the meaning of a painting. When Berger shows the painting that “ is the last picture Van Gogh painted before he killed himself”, before listening to his words, I feel neutral about the painting: it shows a rye and some birds flying above it, neither sad or happy. However, when he tells me that it is “the last picture Van Gogh painted before he killed himself”, I somehow feel regretful about this painting, and start wondering what happened to Van Gogh. As the sad music was on, I feel desperation inside the painting and feeling about the painting became so different from that at the moment when I didn’t hear the background music. When it comes to the realization of such difference, I indeed felt being manipulated by Berger’s words and the background music. Therefore, the power of the sound in depicting a painting is so strong that it can utterly manipulates viewer’s feeling towards the art piece.
